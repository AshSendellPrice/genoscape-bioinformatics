Calling SNPs, whole Enchilada and trying gVCF
================

So, it was pretty easy (about 12 hours) to call all the SNPs from 20 individuals. I don't know how that is going to scale to more (i.e. 192) individuals. That is what I want to find out here: scaling up to 10 times more individuals. If it only takes 10 times as long, no worries. If it takes a lot more, then I have to investigate something else (maybe gVCF a la GATK best practices.)
